Hey there {{ user.first_name|capitalize }},

This is a friendly reminder to file your Mozilla Reps monthly report.

To file your report, click here: {{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('reports_edit_report',
                                                      userprofile.display_name, year, month) }}

If you've been too busy this month and haven't had time to work on
Mozilla Reps stuff, that's totally fine, just make sure to file your
report even if it's empty that way we know you're still active in the
program!

As always, if you have any questions or any assistance filing your
report, don't hesitate to contact your mentor or fellow Mozilla Reps.

Cheers!

The Mozilla Reps Council
