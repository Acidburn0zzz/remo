Greetings {{ user.first_name|capitalize }}!

It's that time of the month again for you to file your Mozilla Reps
monthly report :) These reports are really important for the success
of the Mozilla Reps program as they not only let your mentor see the
great work you do but also give the broader community an opportunity
to see what you've been up to in your region this past month.

To file your report, click here: {{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('reports_edit_report',
                                                      userprofile.display_name, year, month) }}

Of course, all Mozillians are super busy. Sometimes you need to take a
break from all this Mozilla awesomeness and you'll realize you have no
information to share a given month. That's OK! Don't worry about
filing an empty Monthly Report. Just submitting it shows that you're
still active in the program!

Also, make sure to install the Mozilla Reps Companion [1] to your
Firefox to easily submit your next monthly, as well as to have
quick-access to other Mozilla Reps tools and documentation.

As always, if you have any questions or any assistance filing your
report, don't hesitate to contact your mentor or fellow Mozilla Reps.

Cheers!

The Mozilla Reps Council
