Hey there {{ user.first_name|capitalize }},

We've noticed that you haven't submitted a report in more than a month.

If you've been too busy this month and haven't had time to work on
Mozilla Reps, no worries, just make sure to notify your mentor so
(s)he is informed and can be of some assistance if necessary.

To file your report, click here: {{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('reports_edit_report',
                                                      userprofile.display_name, year, month) }}

As always, if you have any questions or any assistance filing your
report, don't hesitate to contact your mentor or fellow Mozilla Reps.

Cheers!

The Mozilla Reps Council
