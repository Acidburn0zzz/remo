Hey there {{ user.first_name|capitalize }},

We've noticed that the following Rep(s) you're mentoring has not filed
a monthly report in more than a month :( These reports are really
important for the success of the Mozilla Reps program as they not only
let you see the great work your "mentees" do but they also give the
broader community a unique opportunity to see what they've been up to
in their region of the world.

Rep(s) without a report for over a month:
{% for rep in reps_without_report.all() %}
{% if rep.userprofile.mentor == user %}
- {{ rep.get_full_name() }} ( {{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('profiles_view_profile', rep.userprofile.display_name) }} )
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

You can head over to the Mozilla Reps Dashboard to get a better
visibility of their status:

{{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('dashboard') }}

Please make sure to get in touch with them and see if they are still
interested in being Mozilla Reps or if they prefer to leave the
program.

As always, if you have any questions or any assistance, don't hesitate
to contact your fellow mentor or Mozilla Reps Council members.

Cheers!

The Mozilla Reps Council
