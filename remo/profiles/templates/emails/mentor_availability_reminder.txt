A while ago, your mentee {{ user_status.user.get_full_name() }} indicated they would be
unavailable until {{ user_status.expected_date.strftime('%d %B %Y') }}.

Please send a note to your mentee to see what activities they want to do,
if they need to be unavailable for more time, or if you can help them.
Here is their email and profile with contact information:

{{ user_status.user.email }}
{{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('profiles_view_profile',
                      user_status.user.userprofile.display_name) }}

Your mentee's profile will still show them as unavailable,
until they update their profile settings.

Cheers,
Your lovely Remo bot!
