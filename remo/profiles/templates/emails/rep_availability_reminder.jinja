Hi there,

If you are ready for Reps activities again, wonderful!
You can do that by updating your profile settings here:

{{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('edit_availability',
                      user_status.user.userprofile.display_name) }}

If you need more time, that is okay.
Your profile will still show you as unavailable until you indicate
you are ready for Reps activities. 
Use the link above when you are available again.

Your mentor has also been reminded that you planned to become available soon.
Whether you are ready for Reps activities or not, we suggest sending a note to them.

Cheers,
You lovely Remo bot!
