Mozilla Reps web tools and portal is the next phase of tools for the
Mozilla Reps program. Its purpose is to provide the required tools for
the day to day operations of the hundreds of Reps signed up in the
program. Diversity of the Reps and Geographic distribution are key
features of the program and those tools should help unify community
practices and tools of mozillians around the world.
